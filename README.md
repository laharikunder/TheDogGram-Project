# 🐶 The DogGram

DogGram is a **frontend UI project** built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
It mimics the look and feel of a **social media feed**, but is designed entirely around **dogs** 🐾.

## 🚀 Future Scope  
DogGram is currently a **static UI prototype** (no backend or database).  
In the future, it can be expanded into a real dog-focused social platform with:  
- 🔐 User authentication & dog-owner profiles  
- 🐕 Posting and sharing dog photos/videos  
- 💬 Real-time likes and comments  
- 📨 Messaging between dog owners  
- 🌍 Explore page for trending dog content  
- 🏆 Badges/rewards for most active dog profiles

👉 Right now, it’s just for fun and design exploration, but it demonstrates how a **dog-only social media app** could look.
